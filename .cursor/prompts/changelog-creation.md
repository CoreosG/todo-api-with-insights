# Prompt

First prompt:

*Note: has context from [adr-006-monitoring-observability.md](/.cursor/prompts/adr-006-monitoring-observability.md) and previous mentioned on the file.

@006-monitoring-observability.md doesn't context mention of ETL pipeline metrics go against the mermaid on @System_architecture.md ? it's an  important feature so i should  update the mermaid to reflect this, i did an oversight.
Generate a changelog.md file and populate it with basic data so i can add the changes to keep track of them, i'll update system_architecture mermaid diagram.

Objective:
generate a changelog.md file with done features, since this is my first change to somethind made before i've felt the necessity to add the changelog.md now.
