# Prompts

Prompt:

Update @next-steps.md at the end to give me a comprehensive guide on everything that was done. detailed report on root exaplaining: all files created, what they do, implementation details, files modified and what changed. explain the stacks in more detail, like what each metric does, what each code does, output formats. identify if all adr were completed, if system_architecture was followed. create runbooks with the consolidated information, if needed merge the current ones into a final one. study the whole codebase, after you finish, generate a readme.md on root with consolidated information about the project (this is different from the comprehensive report). after that activate each venv (api,etl,infra). run the lint scripts if apply, fix, run unit tests and output results (do not fix). 
Make the comprehensive report IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md and make the existing content better, add sections, emojis, things a md file can have.


Objective:
Create comprehensive documentation and testing infrastructure including:
- Detailed implementation report covering all components
- Consolidated runbooks with operational procedures
- Project README with consolidated information
- Unit test execution and results analysis
