look at my current dir structure, should i have a venv for each folder? api,etl,infra.
check @adrs/ specially 000 which contains challenge context.
create a compreehensive step-by-step guide on how i start developing this. should i start by making cdk provision all resources for each stage (api, etl, alll) so i can test directly within aws?
