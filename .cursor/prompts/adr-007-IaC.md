# Prompts

First prompt:
Help me evaluate and choose between Terraform and CDK.
This time you'll have full control over the ADR file, i'll ponder over it and decide my next steps.
Generate prompt for agent mode. Infere all @docs/

Objective:
Learn and decide whether to choose CDK or Terraform or another option, since i have no knowledge of IaC i'll let the A.I handle everything and build-up from that.

*Note: this has context from previous prompts, see [deciding-next-ADR.md](/.cursor/prompts/deciding-next-ADR.md)
